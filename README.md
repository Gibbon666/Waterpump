# Waterpump
Raspberry Pi watering system using a peristaltic pump, and a relay. Trying to mimic what was described here (except without a moisture sensor): https://www.hackster.io/ben-eagan/raspberry-pi-automated-plant-watering-with-website-8af2dc

# Remote Monitoring
I've configured port forwarding and set up an SMTP service which will send me daily emails about the current public IP address, so I can monitor the status of the watering system from wherever I want.
